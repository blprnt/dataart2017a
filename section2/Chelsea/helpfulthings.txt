What is the reading of the text, in fact, except the recording of certain thematic reoccurrences, certain insistences of forms and meanings?
In a novel of fifty to a hundred thousand words… I advise you to observe immediately the words that are repeated about twenty times. Look here…
blood, cartridge belt, commander, do, have, immediately, it, life, seen, sentry, shots, spider, teeth, together, you…

Don’t you already have a clear idea what it’s about?

– If on a winter’s night a traveler, Calvino
